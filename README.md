# KlobucharModel-GPS_delay
The repository includes well-commented R scripts that demonstrate the implementation of the Klobuchar model, covering aspects such as the computation of ionospheric delays based on user coordinates (latitude and longitude), satellite elevation and azimuth angles, GPS time, and Klobuchar Model Parameters (alpha and beta coefficients).
